About the project: My colleague Melzy Wise and I developed a Dublin Core-based metadata schema for a small high school library that balances searchability for students with collection management tools for staff. I designed a two-part RDF structure that separates public-facing catalog elements from staff-only management information, implementing controlled vocabularies from LOC Linked Data service while creating well-formed XML records for a donation of vintage science fiction paperbacks.

About the course:
LIS 4404 Metadata Architectures in the University of Denver Morgridge College of Education's Library and Information Science Graduate Program provides a comprehensive exploration of metadata development in digital environments, focusing on schema design and application across different domains and information communities. Students examine international standards, interoperability challenges, vocabulary control mechanisms, quality assurance approaches, and evaluation methods. Through practical engagement with metadata tools and technologies, students gain skills in creating customized metadata solutions that respond to specific community needs. The curriculum covers the spectrum from fundamental metadata types and standards to advanced concepts in linked data and semantic web technologies, preparing students to implement effective metadata strategies in various professional contexts.
